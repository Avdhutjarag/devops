# Deploying Nginx for Responsive Restaurant Website

This guide provides instructions for deploying an Nginx web server on a standalone server. The example assumes that the application code is available in the GitHub repository: [Responsive-restaurant-website](https://github.com/codersgyan/Responsive-restaurant-website.git).

## Prerequisites

- Standalone server with a modern Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS)
- Internet connectivity for server updates
- Git installed on the server
- Basic knowledge of working with the terminal

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Server and Install Nginx

Ensure your server is up-to-date and install Nginx.

For Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

For CentOS:

```bash
sudo yum update
sudo yum install nginx
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the Responsive Restaurant Website repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codersgyan/Responsive-restaurant-website.git
```

### 3. Configure Nginx

Navigate to the Nginx configuration directory:

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
```

Create a new Nginx configuration file (e.g., `restaurant-website`) and edit it:

```bash
sudo nano restaurant-website
```

Add the following configuration, adjusting the paths as needed:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain_or_server_ip;

    root /path/to/Responsive-restaurant-website;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

Save the file and create a symbolic link to the `sites-enabled` directory:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/restaurant-website /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

### 4. Test Nginx Configuration

Test the Nginx configuration for syntax errors:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If the syntax is okay, reload Nginx to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### 5. Access the Website

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://your_domain_or_server_ip` to view the deployed restaurant website.

## Cleanup

To uninstall Nginx (optional):

For Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt remove nginx
```

For CentOS:

```bash
sudo yum remove nginx
```

**Note:** Ensure to back up any important data before uninstalling.

```

This template assumes a basic Nginx setup and deployment of the Responsive Restaurant Website. Adjust the configurations as needed based on your specific requirements and server environment.
